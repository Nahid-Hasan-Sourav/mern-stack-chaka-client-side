# About Project 


- This is a website for buying and selling second hand cars.
  In this project I am using  tailwind css,daisy ui ,react-router-dom,react-icons,toast etc

- There are three types of users: buyers, sellers and admin.
  If the user signs in with Google, he will be signed in as a buyer. 

- User can sign up as user or seller while signing up.
- Seller can post and advertise for product sale. They will show on the home page.
- Buyers can purchase the product and  then payment status will be  changed for that product.       After this that product will not show in the category page and advertisement anymore.
- Admin can view, delete and verify all sellers.  After verification, seller's post will get verified update
- There is a   blog page
